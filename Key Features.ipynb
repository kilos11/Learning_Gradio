These components correspond to common data types in machine learning and data science, e.g. the gr.Image component is designed to handle input or output images, the gr.Label component displays classification labels and probabilities, the gr.Plot component displays various kinds of plots, and so on.\n","\n","##Each component includes various constructor attributes that control the properties of the component. For example, you can control the number of lines in a gr.Textbox using the lines argument (which takes a positive integer) in its constructor. Or you can control the way that a user can provide an image in the gr.Image component using the sources parameter (which takes a list like [\"webcam\", \"upload\"]).\n","\n","##**Static and Interactive Components**##\n","\n","###Every component has a static version that is designed to display data, and most components also have an interactive version designed to let users input or modify the data. Typically, you don't need to think about this distinction, because when you build a Gradio demo, Gradio automatically figures out whether the component should be static or interactive based on whether it is being used as an input or output. However, you can set this manually using the interactive argument that every component supports.\n","\n","##**Preprocessing and Postprocessing**##\n","\n","###When a component is used as an input, Gradio automatically handles the preprocessing needed to convert the data from a type sent by the user's browser (such as an uploaded image) to a form that can be accepted by your function (such as a numpy array).\n","\n","###Similarly, when a component is used as an output, Gradio automatically handles the postprocessing needed to convert the data from what is returned by your function (such as a list of image paths) to a form that can be displayed in the user's browser (a gallery of images).\n","\n","###Consider an example demo with three input components (gr.Textbox, gr.Number, and gr.Image) and two outputs (gr.Number and gr.Gallery) that serve as a UI for your image-to-image generation model. Below is a diagram of what our preprocessing will send to the model and what our postprocessing will require from it.\n","##Images are converted to NumPy arrays because they are a common format for machine learning workflows.
