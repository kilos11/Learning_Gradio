The diagnosis and a patient summary (name and age) are then displayed in the respective Textboxes.\n","\n","                                    The code follows best practices by separating concerns (the `submit` function handles the logic), using appropriate data types (Textbox for text input, Number for age input, CheckboxGroup for selecting symptoms), and leveraging Gradio's components for a user-friendly interface."],"metadata":{"id":"OmH4oNJyULG8"}},{"source":["import gradio as gr\n","\n","# Create a Gradio Blocks instance\n","with gr.Blocks() as demo:\n","    error_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Error\", visible=False)  # Create a Textbox for displaying errors, initially hidden\n","\n","    name_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")  # Create a Textbox for entering the patient's name\n","    age_box = gr.Number(label=\"Age\", minimum=0, maximum=100)  # Create a Number input for entering the patient's Age\n","    symptoms_box = gr.CheckboxGroup([\"Cough\", \"Fever\", \"Runny Nose\"])  # Create a CheckboxGroup for selecting symptoms\n","    submit_btn = gr.Button(\"Submit\")  # Create a Button for submitting the format\n","\n","    with gr.Column(visible=False) as output_col:# Create a Column for displaying the\n","        #diagnosis and patient summary, initially hidden\n","        diagnosis_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Diagnosis\") # Create a Textbox for displaying the diagnosis\n","        patient_summary_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Patient Summary\") # Create a Textbox for displaying the patient summary\n","\n","         # Define a function to handle form submission\n","    def submit(name, age, symptoms):\n","        if len(name) == 0: # Check if the name is empty\n","            return {error_box: gr.Textbox(value=\"Enter name\", visible=True)} # Show an error\n","            #message if the name is empty\n","        return {\n","            output_col: gr.Column(visible=True),  # Show the output column\n","            diagnosis_box: \"covid\" if \"Cough\" in symptoms else \"flu\",  # Set the diagnosis based on\n","            #the presence of \"Cough\" in the symptoms\n","            patient_summary_box: f\"{name}, {age} y/o\",  # Set the patient summary with the\n","            #name and age\n","        }\n","    # Connect the submit_btn to the submit function\n","    submit_btn.click( # This line was not indented correctly\n","        submit,\n","        [name_box, age_box, symptoms_box],  # Inputs for the submit function\n","        [error_box, diagnosis_box, patient_summary_box, output_col],  # Outputs for the submit function\n","\n","    )\n","\n","\n","# Launch the Gradio app\n","demo.launch()"],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":646},"id":"UiLf65HmTtrI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718478632902,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1802,"user":{"displayName":"KGAOGELO Moloko","userId":"02299502165535871727"}},"outputId":"9bed4990-3b24-4eef-a32c-f603ca388fcd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Setting queue=True in a Colab notebook requires sharing enabled.
