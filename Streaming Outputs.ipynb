Or you might have a chatbot which streams its response one token at a time instead of returning it all at once.\n","\n","##In such cases, you can supply a generator function into Gradio instead of a regular function. Creating generators in Python is very simple: instead of a single return value, a function should yield a series of values instead. Usually the yield statement is put in some kind of loop. Here's an example of an generator that simply counts up to a given number:"],"metadata":{"id":"xQ9ROMDeeg_O"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def my_generator(x):\n","    for i in range(x):\n","        yield i\n"],"metadata":{"id":"swRh3Ojwey-9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##You supply a generator into Gradio the same way as you would a regular function. For example, here's a a (fake) image generation model that generates noise for several steps before outputting an image using the `gr.Interface` class:\n","\n","\n","\n","##Here's what the code does:\n","\n","##1. The code imports the `numpy` module for numerical operations and the `time` module for introducing delays.\n","\n","##2. The `fake_diffusion` function is defined, which takes a single parameter `steps` representing the number of steps in the simulated diffusion process.\n","\n","##3. Inside the function, a new random number generator instance is created using `np.random.default_rng()`. This instance is used to generate random numbers for creating the simulated images.\n","\n","##4. A `for` loop is used to iterate `steps` number of times.\n","\n","##5. Inside the loop, a delay of 1 second is introduced using `time.sleep(1)`. This delay simulates the time required for each step of the diffusion process.\n","\n","##6. A random image with dimensions 600x600 and 3 color channels (RGB) is generated using `rng.random(size=(600, 600, 3))`. The values in the image are random floats between 0 and 1.\n","\n","##7. The generated random image is yielded to the caller using the `yield` statement. This allows the function to be used as a generator, producing one image at a time.\n","\n","##8. After the loop completes, a solid orange image with dimensions 1000x1000 is created using `np.ones((1000, 1000, 3), np.uint8)`. The `np.uint8` data type is used to represent pixel values as unsigned 8-bit integers.\n","\n","##9. The pixel values of the solid orange image are set to `[255, 124, 0]`, which represents the RGB values for the orange color.\n","\n","##10. The solid orange image is yielded to the caller using the `yield` statement.\n","\n","#This function can be useful in scenarios where you need to simulate a diffusion process or generate a sequence of images, such as in the context of machine learning or computer vision applications.
