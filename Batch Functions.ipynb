pass batch functions. Batch functions are just functions which take in a list of inputs and return a list of predictions.\n","\n","##For example, here is a batched function that takes in two lists of inputs (a list of words and a list of ints), and returns a list of trimmed words as output:"],"metadata":{"id":"wVrHdf5TbKMl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##**Here's what the code does:**##\n","\n","##1. The `time` module is imported to use the `time.sleep()` function, which is used for demonstration purposes to pause the execution for 5 seconds.\n","\n","##2. The `trim_words` function takes two arguments: `words` (a list of strings) and `lens` (a list of lengths).\n","\n","##3. An empty list `trimmed_words` is initialized to store the trimmed words.\n","\n","##4. The `time.sleep(5)` line pauses the execution for 5 seconds, which can be useful for demonstrating the function's behavior or simulating a time-consuming operation.\n","\n","##5. The `zip()` function is used to iterate over the `words` and `lens` lists simultaneously. For each iteration, `w` represents a word from the `words` list, and `l` represents the corresponding length from the `lens` list.\n","\n","##6. Inside the loop, the word `w` is trimmed to the length `l` using slicing (`w[:int(l)]`). The `int(l)` is used to convert the length `l` to an integer, as slicing requires an integer index. The trimmed word is then appended to the `trimmed_words` list.\n","\n","##7. After the loop finishes, the `trimmed_words` list is returned as a single-element list (`[trimmed_words]`).\n","\n","##This function can be useful when you need to trim or truncate words in a list to specific lengths. For example, if you have a list of words `['hello', 'world', 'python']` and a list of lengths `[3, 5, 4]`, calling `trim_words(['hello', 'world', 'python'], [3, 5, 4])` would return `[['hel', 'world', 'pyth']]`.\n","\n","##The `time.sleep(5)` line is included for demonstration purposes and can be removed or modified as needed in a real-world scenario."],"metadata":{"id":"7Uqlxub1c1-3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import time  # Import the time module for the time.sleep() function\n","\n","def trim_words(words, lens):\n","        trimmed_words = []  # Initialize an empty list to store the trimmed words\n","        time.sleep(5)  # Pause the execution for 5 seconds (for demonstration purposes)\n","\n","        # Iterate over the words and lengths simultaneously using zip()\n","        for w, l in zip(words, lens):\n","             # Trim the word 'w' to the length 'l' and append it to the trimmed_words list\n","             trimmed_words.append(w[:int(l)])\n","\n","        # Return the trimmed_words list as a single-element list\n","        return [trimmed_words]"],"metadata":{"id":"k3POo0pccEDR"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##The advantage of using batched functions is that if you enable queuing, the Gradio server can automatically batch incoming requests and process them in parallel, potentially speeding up your demo.
